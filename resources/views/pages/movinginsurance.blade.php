                            <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">When you&rsquo;re preparing to move, one of the most important things you can do is research your options for moving insurance. There are a lot of different types of coverage out there, so it&rsquo;s important to choose the right policy for your needs. Here are some tips on choosing the best moving insurance:</span></span></p>

                            <p>&nbsp;</p>

                            <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">1. Know Your Coverage Needs</span></span></p>

                            <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">One of the first things you need to do when looking into moving insurance is to figure out what types of coverage you need. There are three primary types of coverage you could need: liability, property, and cargo. Liability coverage will protect you from legal claims made against you as a result of your move. Property coverage will help pay for damages that may be caused to any belongings during your move, and cargo coverage will cover any items that are transported in or on your vehicle during the move.</span></span></p>

                            <p>&nbsp;</p>

                            <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">2. Compare Rates and Coverage Options</span></span></p>

                            <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">Once you know what type of coverage you need, it&rsquo;s time to compare rates and options. Moving insurance can range in price from just a few dollars per month up to hundreds of dollars per year, so it&rsquo;s important to find a policy that fits your needs and budget. You also want to make sure that the policy has all the coverage you need; some policies only cover specific risks like loss or damage during transit, while other policies offer more comprehensive coverage that includes protection against both property and liability claims.</span></span></p>

                            <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">Before you move, it&#39;s important to get a quote from your insurance provider. This will help you determine if you need any special coverage and can save you money down the road. Here are some tips for getting a quote:</span></span></p>

                            <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">1. Shop Around - Compare rates from different providers to find the best deal. You may be able to find discounts available if you bundle your insurance with other services, like packing and moving companies.</span></span></p>

                            <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">2. Request a Quote in Advance - Request quotes as far in advance as possible to ensure that you have enough time to review and accept them.</span></span></p>

                            <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">3. Make sure Your Policy Covers Everything - Make sure your policy covers everything from lost or damaged items during the move, to accidental damage caused by someone else while in your home or while in transit.</span></span></p>

                            <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">4. Verify Coverage Before Moving - Once you&#39;ve received your quotes, make sure everything is covered by the policy before actually moving anything out of your house. Check with the provider for verification purposes.</span></span></p>

                            <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">First, try calling your moving company and asking them when they will be arriving. Often times, they will be able to squeeze in a move even if it is a few days later than originally planned.</span></span></p>

                            <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">Second, check with your local garage or storage facility. They may be willing to give you a temporary space to store your belongings until the movers arrive. Just make sure that you have reserved this space in advance and that it is close by.</span></span></p>

                            <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">Third, consider using a pack-and-go rental service. These services provide everything from suitcases to furniture boxes and can help save you time and hassle on moving day.</span></span></p>

                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
